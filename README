Sample files included

### to run

run
```shell
python calc.py
```

### Personalize it

You will need 2 images. First paint in white whatever part of the first image
you want to know the area. The rest of the image must not be in white.
Then, in a second image, paint in white the part of the image you want to know
what percentage of area it represents in relation to the first image.

Run the script. Make sure the generated images reflect the parts you wanted it
to detect. The parts will be painted in blue (0,0,255).

If it reflects what you expected, the percentage should be correct.
